Hi there, I'm Jack!

I'm a recent graduate from Boston University, where I completed both my undergraduate and master's degrees. I'm currently seeking roles in Software Engineering, Data Science, or Product Management.

I love technology and enjoy diving deep into technical challenges, but I also enjoy in collaborative environments. I have always gravitated towards collaborative projects, work related or not, have a strong affinty for making the most out of those I'm working with.

Feel free to explore my [resume](/resume/) to learn more about my experience, and check out my [posts](/posts/) to see what I've been working on.
